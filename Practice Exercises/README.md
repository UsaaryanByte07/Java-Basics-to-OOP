# Practice Exercises

This folder contains **true/false-based practice sets** for most chapters of my **Java Basics to OOP** learning journey.  
Each practice set is designed to **test theoretical understanding** of concepts covered in the respective chapter before moving on to coding challenges.

## ðŸ“Š Learning Progress
**12 / 12 Practice Sets Completed**  
*(There are 13 chapters in total, but Chapter 1 has no practice exercise.)*  
ðŸ“Œ More exercises will be added as I progress through the chapters.
