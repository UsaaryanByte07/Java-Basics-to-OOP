## üìå More Chapters Coming Soon
I‚Äôll keep updating this repository as I progress through my Java learning journey.

---

## üìù Notes
- Always compile Java files using `javac` before running with `java`.
- Use `System.out.println()` for debugging outputs.
- Arrays in Java are **zero-indexed**.
- Java is **case-sensitive**, so `Main` and `main` are different.

---

## üéØ Future Plans
- Add **OOP Concepts** with real-life examples.
- Create **mini-projects** after each major section.
- Integrate **Java with Databases** using JDBC.
- Learn **JavaFX** for GUI-based applications.
