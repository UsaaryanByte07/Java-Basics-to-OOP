## About the Journey
I am currently learning Java through the [Java YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL78RhpUUKSweClRi_l05UgfE3053-zkRf&si=utNTYHQhIbd6s4wf) and plan to enroll in a **paid Udemy course** to master OOP concepts in greater depth.  
This journey will not only strengthen my OOP skills but will also lay the groundwork for my upcoming **Java Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** journey.

## Repository Structure
- **Chapters**: Step-by-step learning from basics to advanced OOP topics.
- **Practice Sets**: True/False questions to test theoretical understanding of each chapter.
- **Programming Challenges**: Coding exercises to apply concepts and improve problem-solving.

## Purpose
- Track my **Java OOP learning journey**.
- Build a solid foundation for **Java DSA**.
- Maintain a personal reference for revision and future projects.

## Future Plans
- Complete all chapters with corresponding practice sets and challenges.
- Deep dive into OOP with the Udemy course.
- Transition into **Java DSA** for problem-solving and competitive programming.
